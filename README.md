**WebSocket Client-Server Application**

This project demonstrates a WebSocket-based client-server communication using Python. The server appends a random number to each incoming message and sends it back to the client. The client sends 1000 messages and displays the responses in a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.

**Key Features**:
WebSocket Server: Modifies each incoming message by appending a random number and sends it back to the client.
WebSocket Client: Sends 1000 messages to the server and displays the responses in a Tkinter GUI.
No Message Drop: The client ensures all 1000 messages are received without any loss.
User Interface: A simple GUI that displays the messages using a scrollable text area.
